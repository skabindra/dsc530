###Page 25: 2-1 (Based on the results in this chapter, suppose you were asked to summarize what you learned about whether first babies arrive late…)

I would use ‘Effect size’ summery statistics to get a story on the evening news paper. The result might change with sample size between both the group of first babies and after pregnancies but the effect size with difference of means will give a better perspective.

“Do first babies arrive late” ?

Based on the result set from the examples, the mean summery method can be used as long as the sample size is good and the variance summery method cannot be used since its difficult to interpret in terms of weeks. The Effect size method is useful and can be used and based on the result set . the difference is just about .02% which is insignificant in terms of time.

So my answer to this question would be “No”.  Based on the result set it’s not clear if the first babies arrive late.

####Page 25: 2-4 (Using the variable totalwgt_lb, investigate whether first babies are lighter or heavier than others…)

Based on the script:

Mean
First babies 7.201094430437772
Others 7.325855614973262
Variance
First babies 2.0180273009157768
Others 1.9437810258964572
Difference in lbs -0.12476118453549034
Difference in oz -1.9961789525678455
Difference relative to mean (%age points) -1.7171423678372415
Cohen d -0.088672927072602
Mode of preg length 39
39 4693
40 1116
38 607

37 455



Based on the above result set, the first babies are lighter then the other babies and the variance difference is about -.124 lbs.
